# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Bundled Inter Variable font** at `lib/fonts/InterVariable.woff2` (~344 KB). Loaded via `@font-face` in
  `shared/theme.css` — no external CDN, MV3-safe. `font-display: swap` preserves instant-text-render with the
  system-font fallback while the woff2 loads.
- **Auto light theme** via `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light)`. A full token override inside `shared/theme.css`
  adapts backgrounds, text, accents, borders and shadows for light-mode users. No in-app toggle yet (that ships in
  v2.0.0 as part of the full refresh).
- **`.tabular-nums` utility class** and `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on counters — queue count, log
  timestamps, activity times — so digits no longer shuffle width.
- **Reduced-motion support** — `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` disables transforms and animations.

### Changed

- **Palette refresh** in `shared/theme.css`:
  - `--text-muted` `#5A6B7A` → `#7A8FA3` — now passes WCAG AA 4.5:1 on `--bg-card`. The old value was ~3.6:1.
  - `--accent-red` `#E74C3C` → `#F87171` (Tailwind red-400), hovers and contrast token adjusted.
  - `--accent-green` `#4FC978` → `#34D399` (emerald-400).
  - `--accent-yellow` `#F39C12` → `#FBBF24` (amber-400).
  - Kept Steam-blue `#66C0F4` as primary accent — the extension's identity colour.
  - Introduced `--accent-contrast`, `--accent-green-contrast`, `--accent-red-contrast`, `--accent-yellow-contrast`
    tokens so button and toast text colour flips correctly between dark and light modes.
- **Typography stack** now leads with `"Inter Variable", "Inter", "Segoe UI Variable Text", "Segoe UI",
  -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "SF Pro Text", system-ui, sans-serif`. Inter renders consistently across OSes
  thanks to the local bundle; system variable fonts (Segoe UI Variable on Win11, SF Pro Text on macOS) are the
  graceful fallback.
- **Body** enables Inter stylistic sets (`cv11`, `ss01`) and grayscale antialiasing for sharper glyph edges.
- **Layered box-shadow tokens** — `--shadow-sm/md/lg` are now dual-pass shadows for realistic depth. Harmonised
  with separate values for light mode.
- **`.card` and `.game-card`** now translate up 1–2 px on hover with an accompanying shadow, giving tactile
  feedback without being distracting.
- **Buttons** (`.btn-primary`, `.btn-success`, `.btn-danger`) have a 1 px hover lift and press-down on `:active`.
- **Toasts** use `backdrop-filter: blur(14px) saturate(180%)` with a subtle 10 % border tint, and switched to the
  per-theme contrast tokens. Toast-warning and toast-info no longer fail to contrast in light mode.
- **Popup header** and **Queue / Settings page headers** are sticky with `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)
  saturate(180%)` against translucent backgrounds — gives a modern "frosted glass" feel while scrolling.
- **Scrollbar thumb** adapts in light mode.

### Fixed

- **WCAG AA regression** — `text-muted` was flagged at 3.6:1 on card backgrounds, below the 4.5:1 threshold for
  body text. Now 5.0:1.


### Fixed

- **Singleton-tab behaviour now works across tabs and windows.** The v1.5.0 implementation used
  `chrome.tabs.query({url: chrome.runtime.getURL(...)})` from the popup, which Chrome silently ignores when the
  extension lacks the `tabs` permission and has no matching host permission for `chrome-extension://` URLs. The URL
  filter was being dropped, an unrelated tab was being picked up, and the fallback opened a duplicate. Clicking
  **Queue** or **Settings** from any tab in any window now reliably focuses the existing tab.
- Secondary fix: removed the race between `openExtensionPage(...)` (async) and `window.close()` in the popup — the
  popup no longer relies on in-flight Chrome API calls completing after teardown.

### Changed

- **Tab registry moved to the service worker.** `background/sw.js` maintains a `Map<path, tabId>` of the extension
  tabs it has created. New `MSG.OPEN_EXTENSION_PAGE` delegates the open/focus decision to the sw.
  - sw creates the tab itself → knows the id without needing `chrome.tabs.query`
  - `chrome.tabs.onRemoved` listener drops stale entries
  - Reset Extension clears the registry alongside `detectedGames`
  - Stale id (onRemoved hasn't fired yet) gracefully falls through to a new `chrome.tabs.create`
- **Deleted** `shared/tab-manager.js` — the function now lives inside the sw.

### Permissions

No change — still only `storage` + `activeTab`.

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Push Selected** — each queue card now has a checkbox; the new *Push Selected (N)* button pushes only the checked
  entries. Leverages the existing `pushQueue({appids})` filter in `background/push-handler.js`. Selection state survives
  auto-refresh and is pruned to live entries after every re-render.
- **Scan Page** — a small *Scan* button inside the popup's detected-game card asks the active Steam tab's content
  script to re-run detection without a page reload. Picks up late-loading DOM (e.g. the language table, tags arriving
  after `document_idle`). No new manifest permissions — uses `chrome.tabs.sendMessage` to the existing content script.
  - `content/detector.js` orchestrator refactored: the scrape body lives in `SF2P.runDetection()`, invoked once at
    `document_idle` and again on `RESCAN_PAGE` messages.
  - `content/lib-dom.js` exposes `SF2P.clearDomCache()` which is called before every re-scan so cached selectors get
    re-queried.
- **Undo toast** for *Remove* and *Clear All* on the queue page. A new `showUndoToast(text, onUndo, opts)` in
  `shared/ui-helpers.js` renders an inline `[Undo]` button next to the text. Undo restores the entry(ies) verbatim via
  the new `MSG.RESTORE_ENTRY` path — original `added_at`, notes, and edited fields are preserved because
  `restoreEntry()` and `restoreEntries()` in `background/queue-manager.js` bypass `makeQueueEntry()` (which would
  otherwise regenerate the timestamp).
- `MSG.RESCAN_PAGE` and `MSG.RESTORE_ENTRY` added to `shared/constants.js`.

### Changed

- `queue/queue.js` — shared `runPush({appids, btn, originalHTML, onSuccess})` helper now powers both `pushAllBtn` and
  the new `pushSelectedBtn`, preserving the GPG fallback flow.
- `shared/theme.css` — styles for `.toast-undo` / `.toast-action` (the inline Undo button).
- `queue/queue.css` — styles for `.game-card-select` checkbox and `.is-selected` outline.

---

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **CI/CD release automation** — new `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on any `v*.*.*` tag push. Verifies
  `manifest.json` version matches the tag, builds `steam-f2p-tracker-vX.Y.Z.zip` (excluding dev-only files), creates
  a GitHub release with the tag annotation as body, and uploads the ZIP as an asset. Signed tags are preserved with
  their "Verified" badge.

### Release flow

```bash
# Bump manifest.json version, merge to main, then:
git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "release notes..."
git push origin vX.Y.Z   # workflow does the rest
```

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Singleton tabs** — new `shared/tab-manager.js` exporting `openExtensionPage(path)`. Clicking Queue or Settings in
  the popup now focuses any existing tab (via `chrome.tabs.query({url})` + `chrome.tabs.update` + `chrome.windows.update`)
  instead of piling up duplicates.
- **Auto-refresh via `chrome.storage.onChanged`**:
  - Queue page re-renders live (debounced 150 ms) when entries are added from the popup, removed by auto-push, or
    edited elsewhere.
  - Settings page reloads on settings / GPG-key changes, guarded by `isUserEditing()` so in-progress input is never
    clobbered.
  - Popup keeps the queue count and progress bar in sync while open.

### Changed

- **popup.js** — three `chrome.tabs.create(...)` sites replaced with `openExtensionPage()` (first-run setup, Queue
  button, Settings button).

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- **Detector split** — the 820-line monolithic `content/detector.js` is broken into 9 content-script files sharing a
  `globalThis.SF2P` namespace:
  - `content/ns.js` — namespace init
  - `content/lib-dom.js` — `textOf`, `textsOf`, `hasCheck`, plus **cached selector getters** for `.app_tag`,
    `.dev_row`, breadcrumbs, and `#appHeaderGridContainer` (each was previously re-queried 2–4× per detection)
  - `content/extract-price.js` — schema.org + DOM price, paid-DLC scan
  - `content/extract-type.js` — `isDLCPage`, `isDemo`, `isPlaytest`, `classifyFreeType`
  - `content/extract-platform.js` — `detectOnlineOffline`, `extractPlatforms`
  - `content/extract-anticheat.js` — `ANTI_CHEAT_DB` + two-pass detection
  - `content/extract-metadata.js` — developer, publisher, release date, header image, name, genre, grid-layout helper
  - `content/extract-lang-tags.js` — language table + popular tags
  - `content/detector.js` — **orchestrator (149 lines, was 810)**, assembles `gameData`, dispatches `GAME_DETECTED`
- **manifest.json** `content_scripts.js` lists all 9 files in load order.

### Performance

- **Cached selectors** — frequently-used DOM queries are resolved once per page load and reused by all extract modules.
- **Early-return for DLC / demo / playtest** — the orchestrator now emits a minimal payload (name, header, genre,
  developer, type flags) and skips AC detection, language table, full tag scrape, publisher, release date, description,
  platforms. Saves ~40% scrape time on those page types. Safe because the popup blocks these from the queue anyway.

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Shared UI helpers** — new `shared/ui-helpers.js` exporting `$` (`document.querySelector`), `sendMessage`, and
  `showToast`. Previously duplicated across `popup.js`, `queue.js`, `settings.js`.

### Removed

- **Unused `alarms` manifest permission** — declared but never used (auto-push fires synchronously after each add).
- **Dead exports** (confirmed via grep, zero imports):
  - `OPTIONAL_FIELDS` (legacy alias of `EDITABLE_FIELDS`)
  - `CACHE_DATA_SHA`, `CACHE_TEMP_SHA` storage keys (abandoned caching strategy)
  - `getRecentLogs()` from `shared/logger.js`
  - `clearQueue()`, `getEntry()` from `background/queue-manager.js`

### Changed

- **queue.js** — push confirm dialog no longer references the deprecated `scripts/temp_info.jsonl` path in its wording.

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- **Language scraper** — rows Steam marks as "Not supported" (`<tr class="unsupported">` containing a single
  `<td colspan="3">Not supported</td>`) were bypassing the `cells.length < 2` header-skip guard and getting pushed
  with all flags `false`. `extractLanguages()` now:
  - Primary filter: skips any row with `classList.contains("unsupported")`
  - Defensive fallback: skips rows where none of interface / audio / subtitles have a checkmark

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- **Multi-file dedup via `data/index.json`** — the dedup checker no longer reads a single `scripts/data.jsonl`.
  Instead it reads `data/index.json` (manifest describing all data files and their entry counts) and fetches every
  `data/data_NNN.jsonl` shard in parallel (`Promise.allSettled`). Falls back gracefully if the index is missing or an
  individual shard errors.
- **constants.js** — `REPO_DATA_PATH` removed; replaced with `REPO_INDEX_PATH = "data/index.json"` and
  `REPO_DATA_DIR = "data/"`. `REPO_TEMP_PATH` unchanged — push still targets `scripts/temp_info.jsonl`.

### Added

- `getRawFileContent()` in `github-api.js` — fetches large files (> 1 MB) directly from `raw.githubusercontent.com`,
  bypassing the Contents API's base64 size limit. Used as a fallback by the dedup checker.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

#### New Auto-Detected Fields

- **Description** extraction from `.game_description_snippet` with full description fallback
- **Developer** extraction rewritten — now returns `string[]` to support multiple developers; handles both `.dev_row`
  layout (single dev) and `#appHeaderGridContainer` grid layout (≥2 devs)
- **Publisher** extraction rewritten — same dual-layout support as developer, returns `string[]`
- **Release date** extraction — added fallback to `#appHeaderGridContainer` grid layout (`.grid_label` "Released")
- **Platform** detection from `.platform_img` classes — Windows, macOS, Linux, Steam Play, Steam Deck — with system
  requirements tab fallback
- **Language** table parsing from `#languageTable` — extracts per-language support matrix (interface, full audio,
  subtitles) and flat language name list
- **Full tag list** extraction from `.glance_tags.popular_tags a` — includes hidden overflow tags that Steam collapses
  by default
- **`extractFromGridLayout()` helper** — shared function for parsing Steam's `#appHeaderGridContainer` grid layout,
  used by developer, publisher, and release date extractors

#### Queue UI Redesign

- **Two-panel card layout** — each game card now has two separate collapsible sections:
  - **Game Info (auto-detected)** — read-only panel showing description, release date, developer, publisher, platforms,
    languages, and tags as styled chips
  - **Edit fields** — user-editable panel for genre, type, anti-cheat, notes, and safety rating
- **Genre tag-select dropdown** — replaces free-text genre input with a smart dropdown:
  - "From this game" group: tags detected from the current Steam page (prioritized)
  - "Common genres" group: 30 preset genres (Action, RPG, Strategy, etc.)
  - "Other (type custom)..." option: reveals a text input for custom genre entry
  - Automatically shows custom input when current genre doesn't match any list
- **Tag chips** in auto-detected panel — all Steam tags displayed as compact styled badges
- **Auto field protection** — auto-detected fields (description, release_date, developer, publisher, platforms,
  languages, tags, etc.) are locked and cannot be overwritten via the edit UI

#### Popup Enhancements

- **Extra info line** below game name showing platforms, language count, and publisher (when different from developer)
- **Description preview** — truncated game description shown in the detected game card

#### Push: Full Data Export

- `toTempEntry()` now serializes **all 20 fields** to JSONL — both auto-detected and user-edited
- Fields organized in 7 logical groups: Identity → Classification → Metadata → Anti-cheat → Supplementary →
  Annotations → Extension metadata
- Empty values, empty arrays, and defaults (e.g., `anti_cheat: "-"`) are omitted to keep JSONL compact
- New fields in push output: `description`, `publisher`, `platforms`, `languages`, `language_details`, `tags`,
  `free_type`, `anti_cheat_note`, `is_kernel_ac`, `added_at`

### Changed

- **detector.js** — rewritten with 5 new extractor functions + `extractFromGridLayout()` helper; `extractDeveloper()`
  and `extractPublisher()` now return `string[]` with dual-layout support (`.dev_row` for single, `#appHeaderGridContainer`
  for multiple); `extractReleaseDate()` added grid layout fallback; anti-cheat database expanded from 14 to 20 systems
  (added KSS, NetEase GS, Nexon GP, miHoYo AC, AhnLab, Wellbia)
- **constants.js** — `OPTIONAL_FIELDS` split into `AUTO_FIELDS` (read-only) and `EDITABLE_FIELDS` (user-modifiable);
  `developer` and `publisher` type changed from `"text"` to `"list"`; added `GENRE_PRESETS` (30 common genres);
  `OPTIONAL_FIELDS` kept as legacy alias
- **utils.js** — `makeQueueEntry()` now populates all new auto fields; `developer` and `publisher` default to `[]`
  instead of `""`
- **queue-manager.js** — `addToQueue()` merges all new auto fields; `updateEntry()` enforces field protection via
  `AUTO_LOCKED_FIELDS` set (12 fields) and `EDITABLE_FIELD_KEYS` set (5 fields); rejected fields logged at warn level
- **push-handler.js** — `toTempEntry()` rewritten to include full game data; `developer` and `publisher` arrays
  checked with `Array.isArray()` + `.length > 0` before inclusion
- **queue.css** — new styles for auto-detected panel, tag chips, genre dropdown, optgroup labels, two-toggle layout
- **popup.html** — added `#detectedExtraInfo` and `#detectedDesc` elements
- **popup.js** — renders extra info line and description preview; developer and publisher displayed via `Array.isArray()`
  check + `join(", ")`; publisher comparison against developer uses joined strings
- **queue.js** — complete rewrite of `createCard()` with dual-panel layout, `createGenreField()` tag-select builder;
  developer/publisher rendered as joined strings from arrays; search filter handles array fields

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

#### Core Pipeline

- Auto-detect free-to-play games on Steam store pages via content script DOM parsing
- Schema.org structured data (`meta[itemprop="price"]`) as primary price source with DOM fallback
- Free type classification: `Free to Play`, `Free Game`, `Demo`, `Playtest`, `Paid`
- DLC page detection — automatically ignored (not base games)
- Paid DLC detection via `#gameAreaDLCSection` parsing with auto-note `Paid DLC`
- Online/Offline auto-detection from Steam category features (multiplayer, MMO, co-op, PvP)
- Anti-cheat detection with two-pass strategy: Steam structured `.anticheat_section` parsing (primary) with dictionary
  fallback (20 systems): VAC, EAC, BattlEye, Vanguard, PunkBuster, nProtect GameGuard, XIGNCODE, Ricochet, mHyprot,
  FACEIT AC, Denuvo AC, Zakynthos, Treyarch AC, Hyperion, KSS, NetEase GS, Nexon GP, miHoYo AC, AhnLab, Wellbia
- Kernel vs non-kernel anti-cheat classification from Steam structured data
- Multiple anti-cheat system detection (combined labels, e.g., "EAC + BattlEye")
- Auto-notes pipeline: DLC and anti-cheat info automatically added to queue entry notes
- Persistent game queue in `chrome.storage.local` with 150-entry cap
- Per-entry editable optional fields: type_game, anti_cheat, notes, safe, genre
- Remote deduplication against `data.jsonl` and `temp_info.jsonl` via GitHub Contents API
- Local queue dedup (instant, always fresh)
- Dedup cache with configurable TTL and manual refresh
- Push to GitHub via Contents API (append to `scripts/temp_info.jsonl`)
- SHA conflict detection with automatic retry (re-fetch + re-merge)
- Auto-push when queue reaches configurable threshold

#### GPG Signing (Optional)

- GPG key import with validation (format, expiry, algorithm support)
- Supports RSA, Ed25519, ECDSA, and other OpenPGP key types
- Key metadata display: fingerprint, algorithm, key ID, creation date, expire day, user ID
- Signed commits via Git Database API (create blob → tree → signed commit → update ref)
- Timestamp synchronization between signed payload and API call for GitHub verification
- Committer identity from GPG key UID (email must match for verified signature)
- Separate author vs committer in signed commits
- Fallback to unsigned push with user confirmation when signing fails
- Passphrase-protected key support (passphrase used only during import, never stored)

#### User Interface

- Popup: detected game card with thumbnail, name, genre, developer, free type badge
- Popup: queue summary bar with count, percentage fill, and color indicators
- Popup: recent activity log (last 5 entries)
- Popup: first-run setup banner when GitHub not configured

- Toast notifications for all operations (success, error, warning, info)
- CSS design system with Steam-inspired dark theme and custom properties
- Section fade-in and card slide-in animations
- Spinner loading states on action buttons

#### Logging

- Structured log entries: timestamp, level, category, message, optional data
- Log levels: debug, info, warn, error (configurable minimum)
- Auto-pruning when max entries exceeded (FIFO)
- Export as JSON file with timestamped filename
- Categories: push, queue, dedup, gpg, settings, github, sw

#### Infrastructure

- Chrome Manifest V3 with ES module service worker
- Zero npm dependencies — vanilla JS (ES2022+) and CSS
- 26 files across 8 directories
- Static imports only (MV3 service worker compatible)
- `chrome.storage.local` for all persistent data
- Modular architecture: shared utilities, background modules, UI pages
